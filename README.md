# bitpattern LaTeX package

A LaTeX package to generate compact bit pattern diagrams such as those used
to describe hardware, data format or protocols.

Run LaTeX on the file `bitpattern.ins` to get a .sty to place in your tex
hierarchy.

Run LaTeX on the file `bitpattern.dtx` to get a manual.

Comment out the `\OnlyDescription` command in `bitpattern.dtx` and run
LaTex on the resulting file to get a manual including commented sources.
