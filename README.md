# bitpattern LaTeX package

A LaTeX package by Jean-Marc Bourguet <jm@bourguet.org> to generate bit
pattern diagrams such as those used to describe hardware, data format or
protocols.

Run LaTeX on the file `bitpattern.ins` to get a .sty to place in your tex
hierarchy.

Run LaTeX on the file `bitpattern.dtx` to get a manual.  If the
`\OnlyDescription` command is commented out, you get commented sources in
the manual, else you get only the user's manual part.
